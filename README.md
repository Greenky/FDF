# FDF
***FDF by vmazurok (Valentine Mazurok)***
<hr> 
First graphic project in UNIT Factory.</p> The goal is to convert two dimensional arrays of numbers to three-dimensional intractable mesh using only pure C and minilibX Framework (simple window and creating a colored dot in specified position).

<b> How to use </b>

In MAC OS, open the folder in terminal, type `make` then execute the binary `fdf` with map by first parameter. 
Executable binary also included in repo.
All maps are based in "maps\" folder.

<b> Ð¡ontrols </b>
```
W-A-S-D     :	for move the object
Arrow keys  :	rotate the object
Enter       :	zoom-in
BackSpace   :	zoom-out
```
Realisation also includes color parsing of points in the mesh and color gradient between connections with different colors.
Example : `maps/elem-col.fdf`.
